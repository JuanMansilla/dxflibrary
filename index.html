        <p>This is a DXF library that currently supports entity tree construction and export of this tree to DXF format. 
So, in essence, it is a DXF generator for now. </p>

<p>I have written the library a long time ago for a project for my father. It doesn't contain unit tests - I didn't know what that is back then :) - but it is well written and has been used extensivly very succesfuly in that software.</p>

<p>If you look around the code you will see that everything is simple and clear.</p>

<p>There is an usage example in EXAMPLE.txt.</p>

<p>If you like it and/or use it please let me know. It will me make all warm and fuzzy :)</p>

<p>If you are having any problems with it, also let me know. I will not get warm and fuzzy but I will try to help out.</p>

<p>The license is MIT so you can use it however you want as long as you mention me somewhere.</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>
